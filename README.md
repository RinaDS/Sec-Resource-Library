# Security-Plus-Resource-Library
Welcome to my resource library! I am now using GitHub for my library (for a number of reasons). Here you will find PowerPoint prersentations, links to lots of videos, links to websites relevant to Sec+, eBooks, and more. You can reach me via Discord. My server is at https://discord.gg/w67EHeUmFE. You can also use Github Discussions.
